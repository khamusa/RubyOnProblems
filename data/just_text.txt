Lets write a function (or a pool of functions) that given a quite large text (over than 2000 words) counts how frequent each word occurs in the text.
The text is read from a file and it is a real text with punctuation (i.e., commas, semicolons, ...) that should not be counted.
Note that words with different case should be considered the same.
